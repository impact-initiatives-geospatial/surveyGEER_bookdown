# Preliminary results

This chapter will walk through some of the initial exploratory analysis performed so far

## Overview

Below we show an overview map of the assessment activities carried out in Somalia, Nigeria, Iraq, and Colombia.
Not going to give an overview of each countries climate yet



## Nigeria

Before exploring how remote sensing derived indicators might impact or relate to household indicators/questions we have to first understand what household indicators are most useful and representative of needs/conditions at the household level. Additionally, to relate the indicators designed in the assessment research design to environmental indicators we do need clear hypotheses of why/how an environmental condition could effect these measurements at the household level. This is difficult for an external analyst and is discussed further in the limitation/discussion section.


### Indicators/hypotheses

Going into this exercise we understood that generally food security, income/livelihoods, and potentially health related indicators would be the most opportune ares to relate to environmental indicators. Unfortunately the NGA data is light on food security (see limitations) therefore we shift towards income and start with some research questions and go on to break these into sub-research questions with hypothes:

- overall income for the HH was collected as a categorical ordinal question.
  + Can we identify major drivers of income
- dsalkfadsk


### Income Exploration

Before attempting correlation/association with environmental variables we have to figure out if there are any other major drivers of income that we need to account for. If we plot estimate income by gender HoH (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-ngaIncomeGender)) it becomes evident that male headed households dominate the higher income brackets and female the lower income brackets.



```{r plot-ngaIncomeGender, fig.caption= 'Income vs gender HoH' ,eval = T, results ="asis"}
nga_svy$data_main <- nga_svy$data_main |> 
  mutate(
        overall_income_estimate=xlsf:::label_vec_from_xml(xlsf = nga_svy,q_name = "overall_income_estimate"),
        nearest_health_care = xlsf:::label_vec_from_xml(xlsf=nga_svy, q_name="nearest_health_care")
  ) 


nga_svy$data_main  |> 
   group_by(gender_hoh,overall_income_estimate) |> 
  summarise(
    survey_mean(vartype = "ci")
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x= overall_income_estimate, y=coef,color=gender_hoh))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=`_low`, ymax=`_upp`))+
  labs(x= "HH Income Estimate")+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()+ 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )
```


Since we see this discrepancy let's look at the sample size quickly for 
```{r tbl-genderBreak ,eval = T, results ="asis"}
nga_svy$data_main$variables |> 
  group_by(gender_hoh) |> 
  summarise(
    n=n()
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()

```




Since we know income is important let's have  quick look 

Based on guidance from the country office we used MODIS data to extract the median NDVI anomaly around all for the previous 2021 growing season (June 20 - September 26). If we plot those values against income (just male hoh for now) we do not see a clear trend. We just see that all HHs generally tend to have slight negative Z-score for NDVI in the previous growing season. 


```{r eval = T, results ="asis"}

nga_svy$data_main  |> 
   group_by(gender_hoh,overall_income_estimate) |> 
  summarise(
    survey_mean(rs_ndvi_z_growing_season_21,vartype = "ci",na.rm=T),
    bla=unweighted(n())
  ) |>
  filter(gender_hoh=="male") |>
  ggplot(aes(x= overall_income_estimate,
             y=coef,
             color=gender_hoh
             ))+
  # scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=`_low`, ymax=`_upp`))+
  labs(x= "HH Income Estimate")+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()+ 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )
```

This brings us to a large question mark on how we should aggregate RS data for HH analysis. The MODIS data we are using is 250 m therefore the pixels extracted at the HH do represent an area larger than the HH and could theoretically include small shareholder farming around the HH. However:

- is 250 m sufficient to understand how agriculture/vegetative health in the area surrounding the HH could affect the HHs? 
- Also I did manually scan satellite imagery in NW NGA in combination with the ESA global landcover and what became obvious is that while towns are rural they have a clear footprint. This means that aggregating hh points in the time rural towns would largely be influence by this cleared footprint. Additionally since we are calculating NDVI anomaly using all years on up to date of interest (2000-2021) HHs in new settlements and or settlements that have grown or become more urbanized in any way will be biased towards a negative ndvi anomaly signature
- Therefore we extract the same data, but this time using the ESA urban mask as described in chapter xxx. In summary, we mask the urban area and the apply a focal median  to fill in the masked area. 

First we try it with a focal window size of 4 pixels (1000 meters)

```{r eval = T, results ="asis"}

nga_svy$data_main  |> 
   group_by(gender_hoh,overall_income_estimate) |> 
  summarise(
    survey_mean(rs_ndvi_z_growing_season_21_fs4,vartype = "ci",na.rm=T),
    bla=unweighted(n())
  ) |>
  filter(gender_hoh=="male") |>
  ggplot(aes(x= overall_income_estimate,
             y=coef,
             color=gender_hoh
             ))+
  # scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=`_low`, ymax=`_upp`))+
  labs(x= "HH Income Estimate")+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()+ 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )
```


and then a focal window size of 10 pixels or 2.5 km (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-ndviIncomeFS10)). This exercise seems quite insightful as the expected trend of higher income associated with healthier vegetation compared to normal. You can see that when the focal window was increased the anomaly values become less negative. This could very likely be do to the larger window minimizing the effect of urbanized pixels. 

Now we must ask ourselves why are do the anomalies appear to be generally negative?

- is it because it is a drier than normal year over the entire study area?
- or is it potentially because of this urban affect on the anomalies. The increase in signature associated with increasing the window size suggests this is a possibility. It is quite likely that the ESA urban mask does not capture the full extent of the urban area in these rural towns. In additional to playing with the windows size a urban mask dilation procedure prior to masking should be explored - I hypothesize that the anomalies will shift more to more positive values and this relationship will also strengthen

```{r plot-ndviIncomeFS10, eval = T, results ="asis"}

   group_by(gender_hoh,overall_income_estimate) |>

    bla=unweighted(n())
  ) |>

  labs(x= "HH Income Estimate")+
  geom_point()+

  )
```


Now let's look at rainfall.

    bla=unweighted(n())
  ) |>
  filter(gender_hoh=="male") |>
  ggplot(aes(x= overall_income_estimate,
             y=coef,
             color=gender_hoh
             ))+
  # scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=`_low`, ymax=`_upp`))+
  labs(x= "HH Income Estimate")+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()+ 
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )

```


```{r eval = T, results ="asis"}
nga_svy$data_main |> 
  group_by(overall_income_estimate,gender_hoh,i.have_cattle=`hh_situation/catte_rearing`) |> 
  summarise(
    pct_mean = survey_mean()
  ) |> 
  # filter(i.have_cattle==T) |>
  ggplot(aes(x= overall_income_estimate,
             y=pct_mean
             ))+
  geom_line(aes(group=overall_income_estimate) )+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender_hoh),stat="identity",position= "dodge")+
  facet_wrap(~i.have_cattle,scales = "free")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```


Does having cattle affect reported income bracket?

For female headed households it looks like the answer is no. For male headed households we see that the higher income brackets tend to be more likely to own cattle, whereas the lower income brackets do not.

### Accessibility

Oxford Malaria project produced a global RS dataset in 2019 that predicts walking and total travel times to nearest health center. Here we test it against HH reports of travel times to nearest health center.

```{r}

  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x= nearest_health_care,
             y=pct_mean
             ))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=pct_mean_low, ymax= pct_mean_upp, width=0.2))+

       caption = str_wrap("We see that the remotely sensed walking times to nearest health center do generally correlate with  HH reported travel times. However, RS calculations for HHs that reported over 15 minutes travel time do appear to be too low",180)

### MSNI

It looks like increased rainfall intensify associated with increased MSNI needs, but there is weird spatial element.

## Methodology

RS indicators were made an extracted using GEE. This work is contained in the `{surveyGEER}` repository. Generally the indicators were extracted at the pixel level. Temporal RS data sources with longer timelines were typically preferred over those with shorter time lines so that pixel-values could be normalized to standard scores and indices such as percent mean/median could be constructed.
