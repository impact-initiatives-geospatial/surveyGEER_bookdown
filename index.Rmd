# Welcome {-}

Welcome to Remote Sensing & Humanitarian Assessment Analysis. Here we describe some of the current approaches to integrate remote sensing into humanitarian assessment data. While this book touches on Google Earth Engine, R, Python, and Remote Sensing generally it is neither a beginners guide or a comprehensive look into any of these topics.
