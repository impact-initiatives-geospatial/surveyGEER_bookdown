# Welcome {-}

Welcome to Remote Sensing & Humanitarian Assessment Analysis. Here we describe some of the current approaches to integrate remote sensing into humanitarian assessment data. While this book touches on Google Earth Engine, R, and Remote Sensing generally it neither a beginners guide or a comprehensive look at any of those topics. 

This is an ongoing work and you can visit the books [GitHub Repository](safdad) for more details or if you want to contribute.
