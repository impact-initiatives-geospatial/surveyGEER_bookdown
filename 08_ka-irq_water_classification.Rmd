# Threshold Based Surface Water Classification - cautionary

In certain environments it is possible to obtain a decent water mask from simple band math and threshold techniques. Here we explore the `MNDWI`metric in the context of a reservoir in Iraq. Partners were interested in understanding the rervoir levels/conditions specifically in April 2022 with respect to previous years at the same time of year.

## Take aways {-}
 
 - MNDWI thresholding may provide a decent qualitative understanding of conditions, but we do not recommend putting much weight into quantitative analysis of the resulting water mask.
 - Comparing snapshot of periods of interest can be misleading and more thorough temporal analysis should be done to better understand the surface water dynamics
 - We do observe artefacts from this technique - therefore manual interpretation of results in necessary prior to any conclusions or subsequent analysis or narrative is formed.
 - It is better to use pre-existing surface water layers such as JRC where possible. The difficulty with JRC is that it can be out of date. In these cases more advanced techniques are recommended


While this case study is more a word of caution, we can still use it to learn some cool techniques.


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = F,
  echo = T
)
```

```{r setup_hide_wc,eval=T, echo=F,include=F}
# library(surveyGEER, quietly = T)
# library(rgee, quietly = T)
library(tidyverse, quietly = T)
library(sf, quietly = T)
# library(tidyrgee, quietly = T)
```



Here we look at some threshold maps for water classification. We classify surface water using this technique for a specific month each year.



## Setup AOI

```{r setup_wc}
library(surveyGEER)
library(rgee)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tidyrgee)

ee_Initialize()
```



```{r}
geom <- ee$Geometry$Polygon(list(
  c(44.2354847930793, 34.83077069846819),
  c(44.261577322376176, 34.692001577255105),
  c(44.40851946104805, 34.511140220037795),

))


Map$centerObject(geom, 10)
map_irq_reservoir <- Map$addLayer(eeObject = geom, name = "geom")

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/irq_reservoir_aoi.png"))
```


## LandSat 8 Pre-Processing

- filter temporally and spatially to area of interest
- remove images with >= 25% cloud cover
- rename bands

```{r}

l8_ic <- ee$ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2")$
  filterDate("2013-01-01", "2022-12-31")$
  filterBounds(geom)$
  filter(ee$Filter$lt("CLOUD_COVER", 25))$
  select(
  list("SR_B2", "SR_B3", "SR_B4", "SR_B5", "SR_B6", "SR_B7"),
  list("blue", "green", "red", "nir", "swir1", "swir2")
)
```

- Convert to tidy format for easy monthly composites
- Filter to just April months

```{r}
l8_ic_tidy <- as_tidyee(l8_ic)

l8_median_april <- l8_ic_tidy |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  summarise(
    stat = "median"
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(month == 4)
```


## Band Math and thresholding

- calculate the normalized difference of green & swir1 bands
- calcualte the normalied diffference of green & swir2 bands

```{r}

l8_median_april_mndwi1 <- l8_median_april$ee_ob$map(
  function(img) {
    time_start <- img$get("system:time_start")
    img_mndwi <- img$normalizedDifference(list("green_median", "swir1_median"))$
      rename("mndw1")
    return(img_mndwi$set("system:time_start", time_start))
  }
)

l8_median_april_mndwi2 <- l8_median_april$ee_ob$map(
  function(img) {
    time_start <- img$get("system:time_start")
    img_mndwi <- img$normalizedDifference(list("green_median", "swir2_median"))$
      rename("mndw2")
    return(img_mndwi$set("system:time_start", time_start))
  }
)
```

- Convert back to tidyee class for easy joinning
- Now we have an IC with 2 bands (mndwi1, mndwi2)
- we can create the water mask by thresholding on both mndwi indices.

```{r}
mndwi_tidy <- as_tidyee(l8_median_april_mndwi1)
mndwi2_tidy <- as_tidyee(l8_median_april_mndwi2)

mndwi_tidy <- mndwi_tidy |>
  inner_join(mndwi2_tidy, by = "system:time_start")

water_yearly <- mndwi_tidy$ee_ob$map(
  function(img) {
    time_start <- img$get("system:time_start")
    img$
      select("mndw1")$gte(0)$
      And(img$select("mndw2")$gte(0))$
      set("system:time_start", time_start)$rename("water")
  }
)
water_yearly_tidy <- as_tidyee(water_yearly)
```


## Vizualize Results

- It is critical to visualize the results and explore them maually.
- Here we create a leaflet map and use R and `{purrr}` to iterate and add and label each year as a layer to the map. This can be done GEE javascript, but for R users this may be simpler and a good example of the power of combining languages with the `{rgee}` app.
- In an interactive session you would have all the layers in one map which you could toggle on and off. As this is a static document. We will just display 3 selected maps.


```{r}
years_to_map <- 2013:2022
years_to_map <- years_to_map |>
  set_names(paste0(years_to_map, "_water"))

yearly_water_maps <- years_to_map |>
  purrr::map2(
    .y = names(years_to_map),
    ~ Map$addLayer(
      water_yearly_tidy |>
        filter(year == .x) |>
        as_ee(),
      visParams = list(min = 0, max = 1, palette = c("white", "blue")),
      name = .y
    )
  )


Map$centerObject(geom, 10)

yearly_water_maps$`2013_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2014_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2015_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2016_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2017_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2018_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2019_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2020_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2021_water` +
  yearly_water_maps$`2022_water` +
  Map$addLayer(geom, {})
```


Figure \@ref(fig:map-mndwiwater2013) shows the water mask for 2013


```{r, map-mndwiwater2013, fig.cap='water mask 2013',eval=T,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/irq_reservoir_water_2013.png"))
```


In Figure \@ref(fig:map-mndwiwater2017) we display the water mask for 2017. Here we see some artefacts that look to be negatively affecting our classification.


```{r map-mndwiwater2017,fig.cap='2017 water mask appears to be affected by artefacts and should be investigated furhter', eval=T,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/irq_reservoir_water_2017.png"))
```

And finally the water classification for April 2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:map-mndwiwater2022) )

```{r map-mndwiwater2022, fig.cap='mndwi derived water water mask for april 2022', eval=T,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/irq_reservoir_water_2022.png"))
```

The output shown in Figure \@ref(fig:map-mndwiwater2017) clearly indicates further investigation into the water classificaition is warranted. Nonetheless, for the sake of showing some more `{rgee}` & `{tidyrgee}` tricks we will perform some analysis for the AOI.

## Time series

 - `ee_extract_tidy()` is a wrapper for `rgee::ee_extract()` which offers a little bit more flexibility on the inputs as well as ensures a consistent and tidy returned output. Here we use it to extract the the total number of pixels classified as water in the AOI. **Note:** It is important to include the correct scale of the image.

```{r}
water_pixels_in_geom <- water_yearly_tidy |>
  ee_extract_tidy(y = geom, scale = 30, stat = "sum")
```

```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE}
water_pixels_in_geom <- bookdat$irq_water_pixels_example
```


Now that we have the data in a nice tidy tabular data.frame we can easily apply dplyr and ggplot to manipulate and visualize the data.

```{r,eval=T, echo=T, include=T, results="asis", fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
water_pixels_in_geom |>
  mutate(area_km2 = (value * 30 * 30) * 1e-6) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = area_km2)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Area (Km2)", title = "Approximate Reservoir Area") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Conclusion/MNDWI

the use of MNDWI based thresholding for water classification should generally be discouraged. JRC open source layers and more advanced methods (insert link) should be preferred. Additionally comparing 2 snap shot of time is also discouraged as conclusions drawn from this comparison will generally be misleading. Nonetheless, this technique can be used for a quick initial qualitative assessment. By demonstrating this process we hope to document these takeaways while demonstrating some `{rgee}` and `{tidyrgee}` applications.
